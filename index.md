# Privacy Policy — Squarewaves

**Effective date:** 2026-02-09

This Privacy Policy explains how the **Squarewaves** mobile game (“the App”) handles information.

## Summary
- Squarewaves does **not** require an account or login.
- Squarewaves does **not** ask you to provide personal information (such as your name, address, or phone number).
- Squarewaves is not intended for children under 13.

## Information We Collect
### Information you provide
We do not collect personal information that you provide directly to us.

### Information collected automatically
We do not knowingly collect personal information through the App.

However, **your device and the app store/platform (e.g., Google Play and Android)** may process limited technical information needed to operate and deliver the App, such as:
- device model and operating system version
- app version
- crash/diagnostic information

This information is generally used for security, stability, and performance.

## Advertising and Analytics
Squarewaves does not display third-party ads and does not use third-party analytics **(as shipped in the current version)**.

If we add advertising, analytics, or other third-party services in a future update, we will update this policy and, where required, provide appropriate notices/choices.

## In-App Purchases
If the App offers purchases, those transactions are processed by the app store (e.g., Google Play). We do not receive your full payment details.

## Data Sharing
We do not sell your personal information.

We do not share personal information with third parties, except as required to comply with law or to protect the rights and safety of users and the developer.

## Children’s Privacy
Squarewaves is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will take appropriate steps to delete it.

## Data Retention
Because we do not collect personal information directly, we do not retain personal information from users.

## Your Choices
You can uninstall the App at any time using your device’s standard uninstall process.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will be posted at this URL with an updated effective date.
